#BEAST

##Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees
BEAST performs Bayesian phylogenetic analysis on molecular sequences. It can: 
1. investigate phylogenies using different clock models (eg relaxed, strict) and site models
2. estimate mutation rates and divergence times

3. produce Bayesian phylogenetic trees with posterior probablilites and 95% HPDs 
4. take into account sampling time of sequences (i.e. ancient samples)
5. take into account known priors (e.g. mutation rates; split time with outgroup)
6. partition data (i.e. into coding and non-coding, different genes etc)
7. produce Bayesian skyline plots

This is just the base programme BEAST. Additional modules include:
1. *BEAST: allows estimation of species trees using multilocus data
2. Perform phylogeographic analysis
3. Use SNP and AFLP data
4. Use fossil sample data
