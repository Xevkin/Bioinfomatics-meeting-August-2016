#PSMC
PSMC utilizes the distribution of Times since the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) between the two alleles at loci across the genome (autosomes and X) to estimate the demographic history of the population that individual is from. 
* Recombination breaks up large chunks that have a common TMRCA
* Whole genomes -> multiple loci -> more detailed TMRCA distribtuion -> insight into older demographic events.

###Limitations of PSMC
* Poor resolution for events <20yka (humans). Few recombinations events in that time period -> high variance and inaccurate
* Poor resolution of rapid events. May spread bottlenecks over tens of thousands of years preceding event, etc.
