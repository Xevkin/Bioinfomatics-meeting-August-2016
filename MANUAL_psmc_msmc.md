#PSMC
PSMC utilizes the distribution of Times since the Most Recent Common Ancestor (TMRCA) across the genome to estimate the demographic history of the population that individual is from. 
* Whole genomes -> multiple loci -> more detailed TMRCA distribtuion -> insight into older demographic events.
