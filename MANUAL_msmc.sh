#MSMC - Multiple Sequential Markovian Coalescent model
Developed by Stephan Schiffels and Richard Durbin.

Extends on PSMC on several ways:
* Base model (SMC`) is better 
* Can model more than two sequences - will have more coalescence events in the recent past (<20ky), so can more 
accurately estimate recent population history.
*
